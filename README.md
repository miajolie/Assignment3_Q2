The Kotlin app consists of the following features:
- Create a profile picture with a notification badge using Box.
- Align the badge to the bottom-end corner using Modifier.align().
- Add a toggle button to show/hide the badge (you may choose your badge)

- This app should display only these features once running.
- When the toggle button is clicked, the badge should appear/disappear
